# p5.js Platformer Game

## **Project Overview**
This project is a platformer game built using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/). Developed as part of my university of London coursework, the game combines dynamic graphics, interactive gameplay, and engaging sound effects to create a unique gaming experience. It features various in-game elements such as enemy drones, collectables, canyons, and platforms, all brought to life with creative animations and responsive controls.

## **Key Features**

1. **Dynamic Environments:**
   - Realistic night sky with moving clouds and detailed mountain ranges.
   - Animated backgrounds with smoke effects and glowing particles.

2. **Interactive Gameplay:**
   - Responsive character controls including movement, jumping, and laser firing.
   - Challenging obstacles such as canyons, platforms, and enemy drones.
   - Game state management for game over scenarios and level completion.

3. **Audio-Visual Effects:**
   - Integrated background music and sound effects (jump, laser, death, etc.).
   - Immersive visual animations that enhance the overall gameplay experience.

4. **Mission Briefing & Story Elements:**
   - In-game mission briefings provide narrative context and objectives.
   - State-driven gameplay that evolves as the player interacts with the game world.

## **How the Game Works**

1. **Game Initialization:**
   - The game sets up a canvas and preloads all assets (images, sounds, and video).
   - It initializes in-game elements like clouds, mountains, collectables, and drones.

2. **Gameplay Mechanics:**
   - The character is controlled using the keyboard (A/D for movement, W for jump, Enter for laser fire).
   - Collision detection, enemy interactions, and platform physics ensure challenging gameplay.
   - The game continuously updates the score, lives, and in-game states.

3. **Audio-Visual Integration:**
   - Sound effects are triggered by player actions and game events.
   - Visual effects such as glowing particles and dynamic lighting enhance immersion.
